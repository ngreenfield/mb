# Mini Challenge 1

## Add your home and about pages

### Acceptance Criteria
1. You should have a home page with a description of the purpose of this app (and maybe how to use it)
2. You should have an about page with a short blurb or bio about yourself as the developer of this app

### Note
You will need to create any and all necessary views, templates and urlpatterns to power these two pages.
Consult your previous project(s) for reference (all mini challenges are "open book")

### Bonus
Add custom CSS to your project, ensuring you have the following:
1. A theme for your project (games, movies, etc)
2. A defined color palette
3. Good enough user experience
